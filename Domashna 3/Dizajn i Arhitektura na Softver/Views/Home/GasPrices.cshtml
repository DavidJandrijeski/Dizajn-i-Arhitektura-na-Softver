            <p>
                The law of supply and demand regulates gasoline prices, as it does nearly all commodities.
                Both supply and demand are changing all the time, as new oil wells are discovered and as economic conditions impact consumer demand.
                As a longer-term general trend, the supply of high-quality oil is fixed and dwindling while global demand is increasing with a rising population and economic growth.

            <p>
                The main alternatives to oil and gas energy include nuclear power, solar power, ethanol, and wind power. Fossil fuels still dwarf these alternatives in global and domestic energy markets, but there is considerable public momentum to increase their utilization as industries shift towards sustainability and more green business practices.


                Fossil fuels-comprised primarily of energy sources from coal, oil, propane, and natural gas-account for more than 80% of total energy consumption in the United States.
                Alternative forms of energy have, to this point, proven to be uneconomic substitutes; they are less efficient and more expensive (or, in the case of nuclear power, completely restricted from expanding) than fossil fuels.
                As a result, the government currently provides a lot of subsidies for consumers who choose cleaner forms of renewable energy either for their house or for their vehicles.
                The many oil alternatives are ballooning as more research and development occurs in this space, and as supply and demand laws of economics eventually push down prices to be competitive with traditional fossil fuels.
