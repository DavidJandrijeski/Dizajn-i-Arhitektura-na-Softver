            <br />
            <p id="myDIV1" style="display:none;">
                Biodiesel is a form of diesel fuel derived from plants or animals and consisting of long-chain fatty acid esters. It is typically made by chemically reacting lipids such as animal fat (tallow), soybean oil, or some other vegetable oil with an alcohol, producing a methyl, ethyl or propyl ester.

                Unlike the vegetable and waste oils used to fuel converted diesel engines, biodiesel is a drop-in biofuel, meaning it is compatible with existing diesel engines and distribution infrastructure. Biodiesel can be used alone or blended with petrodiesel in any proportions. Biodiesel blends can also be used as heating oil.

                Ethanol fuel is ethyl alcohol, the same type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages, used as fuel. It is most often used as a motor fuel, mainly as a biofuel additive for gasoline. The first production car running entirely on ethanol was the Fiat 147, introduced in 1978 in Brazil by Fiat. Ethanol is commonly made from biomass such as corn or sugarcane. Ethanol-blended fuel is widely used in Brazil, the United States, and Europe (see also Ethanol fuel by country). Most cars on the road today in the U.S. can run on blends of up to 10% ethanol, and ethanol represented 10% of the U.S. gasoline fuel supply derived from domestic sources in 2011. Some flexible-fuel vehicles are able to use up to 100% ethanol.

            <p1 id="myDIV3" style="display:none;">
                Methanol (CH3OH), also known as wood alcohol, is considered an alternative fuel under the 1992 Energy Policy Act. As an engine fuel, methanol has ethanol-like chemical and physical properties. The use of methanol in vehicles has declined dramatically since the early 1990s, and car manufacturers no longer produce methanol vehicles in the United States. This fuel is generally produced with natural gas which is reformed into steam to create a synthetic gas. Feeding this synthetic gas into a catalyst reactor produces methanol and water vapor. Different raw materials can produce methanol, but natural gas is currently the most economical.

            <p1 id="myDIV4" style="display:none;">
                Methane, colourless, odourless gas that occurs abundantly in nature and as a product of certain human activities. Methane is the simplest member of the paraffin series of hydrocarbons and is among the most potent of the greenhouse gases. Its chemical formula is CH4. Methane is lighter than air, having a specific gravity of 0.554. It is only slightly soluble in water. It burns readily in air, forming carbon dioxide and water vapour; the flame is pale, slightly luminous, and very hot. The boiling point of methane is −162 °C (−259.6 °F) and the melting point is −182.5 °C (−296.5 °F). Methane in general is very stable, but mixtures of methane and air, with the methane content between 5 and 14 percent by volume, are explosive.

            <p1 id="myDIV5" style="display:none;">
                Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), also called LP gas, any of several liquid mixtures of the volatile hydrocarbons propene, propane, butene, and butane. It was used as early as 1860 for a portable fuel source, and its production and consumption for both domestic and industrial use have expanded ever since. A typical commercial mixture may also contain ethane and ethylene, as well as a volatile mercaptan, an odorant added as a safety precaution. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is recovered from “wet” natural gas (gas with condensable heavy petroleum compounds) by absorption. The recovered product has a low boiling point and must be distilled to remove the lighter fractions and then be treated to remove hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and water. The finished product is transported by pipeline and by specially built seagoing tankers. Transportation by truck, rail, and barge has also developed, particularly in the United States.

            <p1 id="myDIV6" style="display:none;">
                CNG, also known as compressed natural gas, is an eco-friendly alternative to gasoline. Made by compressing natural gas (methane) down to less than 1% of its volume, CNG fuel is safer than gasoline and diesel because it is non-toxic and does not contaminate ground water. This natural gas is the same gas that you use daily to heat your home and water, cook on the stove and even to dry your clothes in a dryer. The use of CNG fuel is becoming more popular with both commercial and non-commercial vehicles. The use of CNG is extremely good for the environment. CNG is one of the cleanest burning fuels available. The use of CNG reduces carbon monoxide emissions 90 to 97 percent. In fact, in terms of pollution reduction, converting one truck from diesel to natural gas is the equivalent of taking as many as 325 cars off the road. Using natural gas instead of diesel or gasoline helps reduce tiny soot particles that can aggravate asthma and other respiratory conditions.
